leaflet-beecontrol
==================

A control for leaflet based maps to display beehive locations and flight ranges of bees

An online map using this control (versionv1.0) is [beespace](http://www.homecrossing.de/beespace/).

At the moment a rewrite is going on to allow more than one beehive positions. Please be patient ...

In the directory "example" you'll find an example map using this beecontrol. But keep in mind that some features will not work as intended while the rewrite is going on.
